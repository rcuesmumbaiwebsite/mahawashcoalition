Changes experienced during          the growth years in adolescents have a significant impact on their mental health. Puberty in girls begins          earlier than the physical changes are visible. Menstruation is one of the major changes experienced by          girls during puberty. Early education through discussions and conversations about puberty can help the          girls accept these changes effortlessly.            Academic institutions are of prime importance to bring in this education as well as social awareness.          Department of Education and Sports, Government of Maharashtra (GoM) has thus welcomed the          celebration of Menstrual Hygiene week thereby initiating a dialogue and acknowledging efforts already          undertaken in the state to bring in social change. Awareness campaigns on menstruation and menstrual          hygiene management are conducted in primary schools and tribal areas of Maharashtra with the joint          effort of Department of Education and Sports, GoM and UNICEF, Mumbai, Maharashtra.           Educating adolescents and their parents about the biological process of menstruation, use of sanitary          products, ‘Do’s and Don’ts’ for a healthy life and parent’s role providing healthy living and support to their          child has helped improve overall health of women. This book highlights innovative ways adopted by Master          trainers to overcome hurdles faced in different geographical and social settings of Maharashtra while          conducting awareness campaigns.           As an applaud to their contribution in improving menstrual hygiene, Department of Education and Sports,          GoM with UNICEF Maharashtra and Maharashtra Urban WASH and Environmental Sanitation Coalition          (MAHA-UWES-C) under Regional Centre for Urban and Environmental Studies of All India Institute of Local          Self-government, Mumbai have recognized noteworthy success stories in Menstrual Hygiene Management.          These success stories shall inspire people to break the stigma and build a better world for menstruators to          live in.

The fact that regular menstrual cycles is a          sign of healthy women is undermined by the societal myths and taboos. In many parts of Maharashtra          menstruators are restricted from entering holy places, school and sometimes house as well. Disbelief and          superstitions about menstruation and menstruators and lack of awareness about menstrual hygiene          management has taken a toll on health of many young adolescent girls of Maharashtra.           The Menstrual Hygiene Day is celebrated worldwide on 28th May every year to break taboos surrounding          menstruation and raise awareness about good menstrual hygiene management practices. In the Menstrual          Hygiene Week 2021, UNICEF Maharashtra with Department of Education- Government of Maharashtra, and          its partner organizations had undertaken multiple activities. The week long activities focused on          menstruation and eradicating period stigma by creating a dialogue with multiple stakeholders working in          urban sector. The activities also covered documenting good practices undertaken in Maharashtra,          creating awareness across community members through local level engagement and through social and          printmedia.           UNICEF along with Government of Maharashtra’s Department of Education and sports have been          contributing towards educating men and women across Maharashtra to break the stigma. The main aim of          awareness campaigns is to develop scientific understanding and create dialogue in the society about          menstruation. In Maharashtra awareness campaigns are conducted by identified Master trainers from          schools in each district. The sessions conducted involve discussion and guidance on various aspects of          menstruation like physical and mental health during periods, diet for adolescent girls for healthy, good          habits for during menstruation, and menstrual hygiene management.           Through this book I congratulate all Master trainers and volunteers that are helping and guiding          menstruators to live happy and healthy life. I would also like to acknowledge the team of UNICEF Mumbai,          Department of Education and Sports under Government of Maharashtra and MAHA-UWES-C in compilation          of this book.

Lack of importance towards menstrual hygiene not only affects the           physical health of menstruators but also has grave impact on their mental health. Lack of awareness and           facilities has also accelerated school dropout rates of girls reaching puberty, undermining their ability to           grow as individuals.             Schools are crucial and play a key role in social awareness and behavioral change. Over the past decade,           various efforts have been undertaken in menstrual hygiene management in Maharashtra through State           Departments and valuable contribution of non-profit organizations led by UNICEF, Mumbai, Maharashtra.           These systematic and persistent efforts in bringing in awareness through various platforms and           strategically designed programs has helped broaden the horizon for menstrual hygiene and related topics           in the state.

Girls in the age group of 10yrs to          16yrs undergo many physical and emotional changes which need to be handled in a sensitive manner. This          important phase in the life of every girl and woman is many times stigmatized. Menstruation and          menstrual hygiene are often flanked by superstitious belief.            Efforts are been made at national and state level to eradicate the myths and provide safe access to toilets          and menstrual hygiene facilities through programs like National Health mission and Swachh Bharat          Mission. Joint action of Ministry of Women and Child welfare, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, State          government of Maharashtra and non-government organizations is instrumental in achieving peoples          participation in awareness campaigns especially in vulnerable areas to improve menstrual hygiene          management in Maharashtra.           UNICEF, Mumbai, Maharashtra along with Department of Education and other partner organizations is          making an effort to improve the condition of menstruating women in urban and rural Maharashtra.

Along with this an initiative to develop changing room was undertaken to improve                   access to sanitation facilities.                     What was achieved?                   Campaigns conducted in schools has helped spread social awareness among people about                   menstrual hygiene which has led to behavioral change among adolescent girls. Girls have                   become more confident and reluctance to attend school during menstruation has reduced.                   Access to good hygiene facilities have helped improve physical as well as mental health.                   Sindhudurg district has more than 100 changing rooms formed and maintained through public                   participation.                     Who contributed?                   All changing rooms are developed with the help of the principal, teachers and students from 5th-                   12th standards.

Around 2000 adolescent girls from 5th-12th standards are using these facilities.                                                                                         2","Success stories of menstrual hygiene management in Maharashtra                       A stigma around \"menses\" among the municipal school students and teachers lingered in Nandgav village          of Sindhudurg district. They used to shy away from readily talking about menstruation. But the training          sessions on Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) for teachers encouraged them to speak about the          topic candidly without any fear or humiliation. This awareness was to be brought among girls and their          parents as well. Along with ignorance about MHM, lack of facilities and menstrual hygiene products were          the major barriers to practice what was preached by the MHM trainers of Nandgav villgae.          To break the barrier among male and female members, teachers decided to celebrate birthdays of          adolescent girls by gifting them sanitary napkins distinctly by the male teachers and male members of          family. Even the male village committee members actively participated in the activity. Looking at the          positive support, initiative to improve sanitation facilities in school was undertaken.           To improve sanitation facilities in school, idea of changing room was proposed. Initially, it seemed too          ambitious to propose this in front of the school committee. However, to everyone’s utter surprise, support          from the higher officials was extended and a letter of invitation was sent to the parents of these students          and series of parent teacher meetings were conducted. The concept of changing room in schools was thus          developed and implemented through student teacher and parent participation.           A changing room was made out of an empty abandoned room or a new room whichever was easily          available in school. It necessarily had a functional toilet with running water, a washbasin with handwash, a          stock of sanitary pads, drinking water, a bed with bedsheet, a mirror, towel and detergent powder too. Also,          the rooms are filled with posters, slogans and images giving messages about the menstrual hygiene          management practices.          This in turn has developed confidence among the girls. Innovative way of celebrating birthday has helped          sensitize male members of society and break the stigma. Due to regular guidance and preaching about          Menstrual Hygiene Management from the MHM trainers, the school drop out rate of the adolescent girls          has reduced remarkably. These rooms have allowed girls to attend school regularly and access better          services in schools.                                                                             Smt.

To initiate                   discussions and break the stigma, an action plan for activities was prepared which involved                   interactive awareness sessions and activities to ensure active participation from parents as                   well as students.                        What was achieved?                   The initiative has helped create a dialogue among young girls about menstrual hygiene.                   Commendable behavioral changes can be observed among girls and their parents. Early                   education to school girls has helped overcome their fear for first period.                      Who contributed?                   All teachers from Pachad School No. 1 were the major contributors in conducting awareness                   sessions and activities among students. Support from principal of Pachad School No. 1 and                   gram panchayat members was noteworthy. Other than this, active participation of girls from                   class 5th to 10th and their parents helped implement the program successfully.             Who were impacted?

Department of          education and sports, Government of Maharashtra has been conducting awareness programs on issues          stigmatized by the society. One such topic is menstruation. MHM trainers from Pachad School number 1          have been actively conducting awareness sessions in school to educate girls and their parents about          menstrual hygiene management.           MHM trainers from this school worked out an action plan to conduct a series of sessions and activities          through out the year to initiate important discussions. It aimed at involving parents and adolescent girls to          create a dialogue among them about menstrual hygiene.           Sessions in the first half of the year were dedicated to educating girls and parents about various aspects of          menstruation while other sessions were conducted through active participation of girls through activities          like slogan making and play for parents and male members in school.           First session was conducted on ‘Parents role in providing healthy living to their girl child’. In this session          biological information on menstruation and physical changes experienced during puberty were conveyed.          In the following session parents and girls were informed about Do’s and Don'ts during menstruation, use of          sanitary products and diet for good health.           Looking at the popularity of 90s cartoon character Meena and Raju, stories for menstrual hygiene          management were conceptualized. Since then these stories have been used to educate 10 - 14 age group          girls and their mothers about good practices in menstruation for healthy life. Meena - Raju characters          helped build and spread social message among the youth.           In the interactive sessions parents and students shared their experiences and discussed problems faced          during menstruation. This helped create dialogue between students and parents. Last three sessions          comprised of information, education and communication (IEC) activities through girls like poster making,          slogan preparation and street play. In the final session, an act was performed using these slogans and          posters by girls to spread awareness among parents and other village members.          These activities have inculcated awareness among girls like maintaining good hygiene during          menstruation, recording menstrual cycle and having a healthy diet.

Hence, MHM trainers (male teachers) in this village set up a platform in the form                   of ‘Mazhi Didi’ helpline number, to discuss issues related to menstrual hygiene.                        What was achieved?                   Helpline number has become a popular medium for expressing emotional distress and spread                  awareness among younger girls. Awareness campaigns have helped reduce rate of infections and                  fatalities due to unhygienic conditions during menstruation among menstruators. Overall it is                  helping girls to maintain good physical as well as mental health.                     Who contributed?                  Along with primary school teachers of all schools in Shahuwadi taluka, contribution of female                  volunteers from colleges and NGOs was of prime importance. Support from Panchayat samiti of                  Shahuwadi and Principal of District Education and Skill Development Institute was noteworthy.             Who were impacted?

At this stage boys as           well as girls undergo physical and mental changes. During this age, providing health education helps in           overall development of students; menstrual hygiene management being one of it. Children of these taluka           were unaware and lacked scientific knowledge about biological changes experienced by girls during their           puberty.            The southern part of Shahuwadi taluka in Kolhapur district is rural. Also there are no female teachers in           any primary schools of Anuskura and Karanjaphen to guide and help adolescent girls during their first           period or discuss concerns related to menstruation. Girls are also quite reluctant to discuss concerns           regarding menstruation with male teachers in the school.           To address this issue MHM trainers (male) in primary schools of Anuskura and Karanjaphen started an           awareness campaign named ‘Kali Khulwana’ in schools and tribal areas of these villages. Through this           program, women are educated about the importance of menstrual hygiene, use of sanitary products and           Dos and Don'ts during periods. Earlier, menstruation was considered as ‘problem’ as myths and unhygienic           practices during menstruation led to severe infections among girls. Eradicating myths surrounding           menstruation was one of the key objective of this program.           Since there are no female teachers in any primary school in these villages, a helpline number was set up           with the help of NGOs and volunteers from colleges. ‘Mazhi Didi’ helpline number helped adolescent girls           discuss concerns during their first periods and related health issues. Female volunteers from colleges           addressed these calls. ‘Mazhi Didi’ helpline number has become a strong medium for expression during           menstruation. The helpline number serves as an important platform to help girls improve mental as well as           physical health and eradicate myths about menstruation.

Taking this into consideration, efforts were undertaken by teachers in                   developing menstruation friendly toilets and educating girls about menstrual hygiene.                         What was achieved?                   Changing rooms are helping menstruators maintain hygiene and take short breaks from long                   school hours instead of taking a leave. Vending machines provide access to sanitary pads at                   minimal rate. Students have made red dot paper hanger and red dot dustbin for disposal of                   sanitary napkins. Awareness sessions by gynecologists have created an impact on girls. Due to                   this girls have become diligent towards recording menstrual cycle, hand washing and proper                   disposal of used sanitary pads.                    Who contributed?                   Awareness and changing room initiative involved participation from students, teachers,                  headmaster, parents and villagers. Gram panchayat provided financial support and manpower                  for developing changing room and facilities there in. The vending machines and napkins are                  financed by the Loopin Foundation.            Who were impacted?           The initiative has helped around 200 girls in Zilla Parishad School of Ladsavangi.                            11","Success stories of menstrual hygiene management in Maharashtra                      Taboo around menstruation hampers initiation of a critical dialogue. It thus prevents development of           essential infrastructure necessary for young girls to have a hygienic period. A small impetus on building           menstruation friendly facilities allows girls learn healthy practices around menstruation.            School drop outs and low attendance in classes has been a major concern for girl students in Z. P. school,           Ladsavangi. They lacked access to safe menstruation facilities like toilets, sanitary napkins and other           hygiene products. Taking this into consideration, efforts were undertaken by teachers in developing           menstruation friendly toilets and educating girls about menstrual hygiene.           Realizing the need for menstrual hygiene management facilities to improve attendance of girls, teachers           have undertaken the initiative to create changing rooms which were equipped with functional toilets,           running water, a washbasin with handwash and a stock of sanitary napkins. The rooms also have drinking           water, a bed, a mirror, towel and detergent powder. This has helped girls sustain the long school hours           during periods and improved their attendance.            Along with provision of facilities, educating girls and addressing the curiosities of both boys and girls           about menstruation was thought to be necessary. For this awareness sessions under the guidance of           subject experts and gynecologists are conducted.           Surveys were also conducted among students during these awareness sessions which showed that most           girls were unaware about puberty, the biological reasons for menses. They lacked knowledge on use of           sanitary napkins, disposal techniques and use of incinerators.           Understanding the problem of sanitary waste disposal in rural areas and methods of sanitary waste           management were also discussed. Covers for soiled sanitary pads with red dot, separate dustbins and           incinerators are installed to facilitate onsite disposal of menstrual waste.

Lack of education and illiteracy created a                    communication gap between the Z.P. teachers of Sakri taluka and villagers. The gap was                    bridged through poems and rangoli exhibitions that depicted biological process of                    menstruation and menstrual hygiene management practices. A compilation of these poems                    was published through ‘Udita’.                       What was achieved?                    Poems and art works helped in delivering the message to uneducated tribal women and girls.                    ‘Udita’ served as a platform for the MHM trainers to express and spread awareness about                    menstrual hygiene in an innovative way. Rangolis served as best visual medium to                    communicate with the tribal women.

To complete the book and conduct rangoli exhibition, teachers from Z.P. schools in Sakri                    Dr.Shobha Khandare, Dr.Prabhakar Kshirsagar were instrumental. Smt.

In following years this believe was encompassed by myths and          superstitions. Prevailing illiteracy tabooed menstruation and menstruators and termed impure.           Similar situation was experienced in Bhoicha Pada village of Sakri taluka in Dhule district. Disbelief and          superstitions about menstruation and menstruators in the society was taking toll on health of the          menstruators.           Due to inadequate exposure to education facility among the tribals of Bhoicha Pada village, the approach          towards spreading awareness in terms of menstruation had to be different. The communication gap was          bridged by using art and literature for awareness. With the help of teachers and principals of schools, an          anthology of poems and verses was published. Using these verses and poems, awareness campaigns were          conducted to burst the myths and taboos related to menstrual hygiene and menstruation. Poems and          verses were complied in a book ‘Udita’. It serves as a medium to educate girls in schools of Sakri taluka          and platform to the change makers and menstruators.          To burst the myths and taboos surrounding menstrual hygiene, Rangoli exhibitions on menstrual hygiene at          social gathering places were organized to spread awareness among tribals.

Thereafter they conducted menstrual hygiene management sessions for students of municipal                   schools across the district.                     What was achieved?

They were about awareness of menstrual                  hygiene management to curb the disbeliefs around menstruation which led to social practices                  like isolating during menstruation due to which girls have to miss many days of school or drop                  out from school.                       What was achieved?                  The students confidently talk about menstruation and receive support from school management                  committee with respect to this topic. The most effective thing is that in this training, a new cadre                  of young students are getting ready to spread awareness about menstrual hygiene management.                     Who contributed?                  There was immense support from all the officials of the DIET department. Further, guidance from                  Smt. Aparna Kulkarni from UNICEF, Maharahstra gave a direction to the MHM trainer to create                  awareness about MHM on a large scale.             Who were impacted?           Approximately 20,000 students from rural and urban areas of Maharashtra and around 10,000 laboureres,          parents and Asha workers from remote areas were impacted.                             23","Success stories of menstrual hygiene management in Maharashtra                          Girls coming from far away places would remain absent due to menstruation. Also, when their mothers           would menstruate, daughters would have to cook and thus would come late to school.           In 2014, after discussing with the girls, it was seen that women and girls were living separately outside the           barn during the menstrual period. In discussion with mothers about stopping this ritual, they feared God's           wrath upon them, the fear that something bad would happen in our house and many other superstitions.             After this Ms. Sakshi Katam, daughter of Smt. Sunita Katam accompanied her mother to impart information           about Menstrual Hygiene Management through the school program Navratra and Prabodhan. This was           carried out jointly with the Department of Education of Maharashtra and UNICEF, who gave them training in           menstruation management. There was an invitation to lecture for an online session due to the pandemic. It           was then noticed that four hundred students and teachers are sitting in their classrooms and training           properly through laptops and speakers. The success of this program gave inspiration to the mother and the           daughter. The importance of this work was realized once again by the Menstrual Hygiene Management           trainer- Ms Sunita Katam and she decided to undertake their work on creating awareness on menstruation           by conducting online trainings for the school students of the taluka.            With the support from various NGOs, clubs, SHGs and other frontline workers, they reached out to the           talukas. Here, Ms. Sakshi Katam assisted in training program by handling technical matters. Creating a link,           sending it to the teacher, taking the program on time, soliciting children's feedback, and many other things           where handled by her, while her mother was undertaking awareness sessions. They successfully completed           the online training of a thousand students. Based on the feedback from previous trainings they planned the           next trainings. For this they collected feedbacks on Google form from the participants after every training.           This activity started from 5th September 2014 and is ongoing now too.                                                                                    Smt.

What was achieved?                   Menstruation is no more a topic to be stigmatized, rather it has become a topic of discussion in                  Amravati.

My mother had told me that I                have grown up, when I got my periods. She would not allow me to use sanitary pads nor go out                 to play. After the awareness program conducted, I am allowed to go to school everyday. We                     have pad banks in schools and so we don’t need to miss school during the periods.                                                          Smt.
